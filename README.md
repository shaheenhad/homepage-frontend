This is the final project I developed for the Practicum Software
Engineering bootcamp, which makes use of Create React App, responsive
web design via CSS, and Fetch API.

This site functions as a user's browser homepage and features common bookmarks, dynamic design based on time of day, and a refreshable quote of the day via Quotable API.
